# ARMtix images for rpi4

This is a collection of premade images of ARMtix on Raspberry Pi, the root filesystem can be downloaded from [the offical website](https://armtix.artixlinux.org/).

The main reason this exists is so that users less familiar with linux and how the Raspberry Pi boot loader works have a easy way to install and use ARMtix.

**_I didn't create ARMtix, I just made these images, be sure to support the actual developers_**

## Installation

Either use the Raspberry Pi Imager tool or dd to flash the image files onto a SD card and insert it into the Raspberry Pi board. Armtix should boot, more user configuration is required and can be found at [the official website](https://armtix.artixlinux.org/).
